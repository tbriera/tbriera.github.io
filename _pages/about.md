I am a 3rd year PhD Student at CIRED. My research interest focuses on the barriers to accelerated climate action and solutions to overcome these barriers, with an Integrated Assessment Modeling approach.

I'll be looking for a post-doc position by the end of 2024 in the field of Integrated Assessment Modeling.
